# python-loupedeck-live

Python interface to Loupedeck Live.

This is a quick python port of [loupedeck](https://github.com/foxxyz/loupedeck) for Node.Js.
There is also another package for Loupedeck-CT [loupedeck-ct](https://github.com/bitfocus/loupedeck-ct).

The structure of the package was copied from [streamdeck](https://github.com/abcminiuser/python-elgato-streamdeck)
which does a similar integration for Elgato Streamdeck devices.

Both use [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org) module for image manipulation.
